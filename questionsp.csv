P001,"The solar system is made up of the sun and everything that orbits around it. This includes eight planets, dozens of moons, asteroids, comets, and other space rocks. The sun is at the center of the solar system and provides heat and light to all the planets. The four inner planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, which are also called the rocky planets. The outer planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, known as the gas giants.",Q001-1,How many planets are in our solar system?,8,Q001-2,What is at the center of the solar system?,The sun,Q001-3,Name one of the inner planets.,Mercury/Venus/Earth/Mars,Q001-4,What are the outer planets also known as?,Gas giants,Q001-5,What does the sun provide to all the planets?,Heat and light
P002,"Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make their own food. They use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and energy in the form of sugar. The green pigment in plants called chlorophyll helps absorb the sunlight. This process takes place in the leaves of the plant. Photosynthesis is important because it provides oxygen for all living things to breathe and is the basis of most food chains on Earth.",Q002-1,What do plants use to make their own food?,Sunlight/water/carbon dioxide,Q002-2,What green pigment helps plants absorb sunlight?,Chlorophyll,Q002-3,Where does photosynthesis take place in a plant?,Leaves,Q002-4,What gas does photosynthesis produce that living things need to breathe?,Oxygen,Q002-5,In what form do plants store the energy they produce?,Sugar
P003,"The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. The main components of the water cycle are evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection. The sun heats water in oceans, lakes, and rivers, causing it to evaporate into water vapor. This vapor rises into the atmosphere, cools, and condenses into clouds. When the clouds become heavy, the water falls back to Earth as precipitation in the form of rain or snow. This water then collects in bodies of water or seeps into the ground, and the cycle begins again.",Q003-1,What is another name for the water cycle?,Hydrologic cycle,Q003-2,What causes water to evaporate in the water cycle?,The sun,Q003-3,What are clouds formed from in the water cycle?,Condensed water vapor,Q003-4,Name two forms of precipitation mentioned.,Rain and snow,Q003-5,How many main components of the water cycle are mentioned?,Four
P004,"The human body has 11 major organ systems that work together to keep us alive and healthy. These include the circulatory system, respiratory system, digestive system, nervous system, and immune system, among others. The circulatory system, led by the heart, pumps blood throughout the body. The respiratory system, centered on the lungs, brings oxygen into the body and removes carbon dioxide. The digestive system breaks down food for energy and nutrients. The nervous system, with the brain at its center, controls our thoughts and movements. The immune system helps protect us from diseases and infections.",Q004-1,How many major organ systems does the human body have?,11,Q004-2,Which organ is at the center of the circulatory system?,The heart,Q004-3,What does the respiratory system bring into the body?,Oxygen,Q004-4,What is the main function of the digestive system?,To break down food for energy and nutrients,Q004-5,Which system controls our thoughts and movements?,The nervous system
P005,"Electricity is a form of energy resulting from the movement of charged particles, usually electrons. It can be produced in several ways, including through the burning of fossil fuels, nuclear reactions, or renewable sources like solar and wind power. Electricity flows through conductors, such as metal wires, and can be used to power lights, appliances, and other devices. It's measured in units called watts or kilowatts. The invention of ways to generate and use electricity has dramatically changed modern life, powering everything from small gadgets to large factories and cities.",Q005-1,What particles usually create electricity when they move?,Electrons,Q005-2,Name one renewable source of electricity mentioned.,Solar or wind power,Q005-3,Through what material does electricity flow?,Conductors/metal wires,Q005-4,In what units is electricity typically measured?,Watts or kilowatts,Q005-5,What has the invention of electricity changed according to the paragraph?,Modern life
